        <h3><i class="fab fa-connectdevelop"></i>Polytopic Representation of Music.</h3>
        <h2>Polywhat?</h2>
        A polytope is a mathematical object, with several different definitions. Then, let's redefine it! (yay!)<br>
        Here, we will restrict "polytope" to n-cubes, or altered n-cubes. More particularily, we will only focus on the set and edges of the polytope, which is called the "polytope graph" in the litterature.	Polytopes, in our context, fall into 2 classes:
        <ul>
          <dl>
            <dt>Regular polytopes</dt>
            <dd>- These will simply cover the generalizattion of cubes. Hence, a 3-regular polytope is a cube, a 2-regular-polytope is a square, and a 4-regular-polytope is a tesseract, or hypercube.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Irregular polytopes</dt>
            <dd>- n-regular-polytopes on which we have added and/or deleted a smaller polytope (at most (n-2)-regular-polytopes). Typically, a cube where we deleted a vertex is an irregular polytope.</dd>
          </dl>
        </ul>
		Under this definition, a n-regular polytope will contain 2<SUP>n</SUP> vertices, and can be seen as the concatenation of 2 (n-1)-regular polytopes.<br>
    They were introduced in Corentin Guichaoua's PhD thesis [4]. It is planned in near future to present a document (in english) explaining these polytopes.<br>
    <br>
        But first, let's start with another model: the System and Contrast.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>S&C: System and Contrast model [1]</h2>
        The S&C model is a model which links 4 elements. The first 3 will represent a system, and the 4-th will be compared to the 3 others, to form a contrast (which can be null).
        <br>
        Before a more precise explanation, take a look at the follwoing picture (from [3]).
        <img class="content-img" src="/assets/images/s_and_c.png"/>
        In the previous examples, we infer a logical sequence from the 3 first elements, and try to predict the 4-th element in this logic.
        <br>
        The "logical sequence" is the system, and the difference between the prediction and the "real" 4-th element is the contrast.
        <br>
        Formally, let x1, x2, x3 and x4 be a 4 element sequence. We will try to find two functions from it:
        <ul>
          <li>- f, where x2 = f(x1)</li>
          <li>- g, where x3 = g(x1)</li>
        </ul>
        and we will compose the two functions to obtain a prediction f(g(x1)).
        <br>
        The contrast is then f(g(x1)) - x4.
        <br>
        Finally, if x1, f, g and the contrast are quantitative (we assume that they are in our context), we can define a S&C cost of our sequence:<br>
        cost(sequence) = cost(f) + cost(g) + cost(contrast)
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Regular polytopes [2]</h2>
        <p><strong>Note: for now, all the presented models (and also the figures) come from C. Louboutin's work (principaly [2], but also his thesis [3]).</strong></p>
        We present below a 4-regular-polytope (an hypercube).
        <img class="content-img rel-small" src="/assets/images/4-polytope.png"/>
        This polytope has 16 vertices, indexed from 0 to 15, with edges connecting some of them.
        <br>
        The idea is to put, on each vertex, a musical element (typically, a chord). In a 4/4 time metric, 4 bars represents 16 beats.
        <br><br>
        Let's take a musical passage of 4 bars, each containing 4 beats. We will represent each beat of this passage as a vertex in the polytope, by simplifying the content in each beat to a unique chord (the principal one).
        <br>
        Hence, our polytope now define a 16 elements musical passage. Great! But what's the point?<br>
        <br>
        The trick is that this 4-regular-polytope can also be seen as 5 systems of 4 elements: 4 systems linking 4 consecutive elements (0/1/2/3, 4/5/6/7, 8/9/10/11 and 12/13/14/15), and a 5-th system linking the first elements of these systems (0/4/8/12).
        <img class="content-img not-too-big" src="/assets/images/4-polytope-squares.png"/>
        Hence, this 4 bars passage be seen as 5 S&C models.<br>Et voilà ! By summing the costs of each of these systems, we have defined a cost for this musical passage.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Well, almost.</strong> What is the cost of the relations between elements when talking about musical passages?
        <br>
        Many costs can be implemented, for instance reducing each chord on each vertex to its closest triad, and then consider the difference between two chords as a rotation in the circle of thirds (presented below), closely related to the circle of fifths.
        <img class="content-img rel-small" src="/assets/images/circle_thirds.png"/>
        <strong>And what about audio signals?</strong><br> Well, <s>that's actually my contribution!</s> I was planning on extending this work to audio signals, but I wasn't able to to do so. If you're interested for this task, you can contact me at axel.marmoret.at.irisa.fr or contact Frédéric Bimbot at bimbot.at.irisa.fr.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Irregular polytopes [4]</h2>
        Regular polytopes are great, but what can we do when segments aren't of size 2**n (4, 8, 16, 32)?<br>
        For this task, C. Guichaoua introduced irregular polytopes. Some of them are presented below.
        <img class="content-img" src="/assets/images/irreg_polytopes.png"/>
        Basically, it allows us to define a polytope for a lot (but not all!)* of segments sizes.<br>
        The challenging work here is to extend the previous S&C model to non-4 elements (done in the seminal paper, but not on Corentin's work) and to adapt this to audio signals (as before).<br>
        <small>*I don't want to detail their generation here, but basically, as we only alter regular polytopes with other regular polytopes, some size remain inaccessible.</small>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Code</h2>
        Python code for this work, mixing both models, is available at <a class="inner-link" href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/amarmore/musiconpolytopes" target="_blank">this link</a> (for symbolic music only).<br>
        It's still under development, and lacks of (a lot) of explanations, but it's a first step! You can start by looking at the <a class="inner-link" href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/amarmore/musiconpolytopes/-/blob/master/Notebooks/Tutorial%20-%20Handling%20polytopes.ipynb" target="_blank">Tutorial Notebook</a>.<br>
        Don't hesitate to warn me if you encounter a bug or any problem!
