  <h2>Tensors and NTD general model.</h2>

  NTD is a tensor factorization technique.<br>
  Formally, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array. In our work, we focus on 3-rd order tensor (at least for now).
  <img class="content-img not-too-big" src="/assets/images/tensor.png"/>
  As we focus on 3-rd order tensors, we will restrict "tensors" to 3-rd order ones.<br>
  <br>
  Given a nonnegative tensor X, NTD decomposes it in three factor matrices, one per mode, and a core tensor linking these matrices.
  <img class="content-img" src="/assets/images/NTD.png"/>
  <br>
  <h2>Application to Music.</h2>
  Let's consider the spectrogram of a Music, that is a two-dimensional time-frequency (or frequency-ish representation) matrix.
  <br>
  We split this matrix on each downbeat (in order to obtain a spectrogram for each bar of the song),
  and refold the obtain matrices in a tensor, with three dimensions. We can also see this operation as the concatenation of matrices along a third dimension.
  <img class="content-img not-too-big" src="/assets/images/tfb.png"/>
  In that sense, we obtain a tensor with two time dimensions: a low scale (inner-bar time), and an upper-scale (bar indexes).
  We then decompose this tensor with the NTD model.<br>
  <br>
  <h2>Interpretation of NTD, in our context.</h2>
  As the three factor matrices each represent a mode, each of them represent factors of a specific dimension. In our context:
  <ul>
    <li>- W represents frequency information, that is, each column of W will represent a frequential template. We then hope that each of these templates will represent an note, a chord, or at least a musically salient object.</li>
    <li>- H represents the inner-bar time, that is, each column of H will represent a time template, at the scale of a bar. It can be seen as a rhtyhmic template.</li>
    <li>- Q represents time at the barscale. It is hard to interpret Q without an understanding of the core tensor G, so we will come back to that right after.</li>
  </ul>
  Finally, the core tensor G links all these matrices. Below is a gif which shows how these elements are connected.
  <img class="content-img" src="/assets/images/ntd.gif">
  As presented above, each slice of the core tensor G will link columns of W and H, that is, frequential and rhythmic patterns.
  Hence, each slice of G, mutiplied by W and H, is a time-frequency representation of some of their columns.<br>
  It is then a spectrogram at the bar scale, composed of factorized elements. We call that representation a "musical pattern".<br>
  <br>
  Each slice of G is associated with a column of Q. In that context, each column of Q indicates the weight of this musical pattern in all bars of the song.
  <br>
  Hence, Q is a barwise representation of the song, with musical pattern as features.<br>
  <br>
  <h2>In practice: NTD for segmentation</h2>
  Finally, starting from this representation, we developed and tested a segmentation algorithm, which resulted in <a class="inner-link" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02928733v1" target="_blank">a publication in ISMIR 2020</a>.<br>
  In short, the idea of the segmentation algorithm is to study this barwise representation Q, and notably its autosimilarity, to obtain barwise similarity coefficients. The higher a zone is in terms of similairty, the more probable it belongs to a same segment. Details about this segmentation technique can be found <a class="inner-link" href="./resources/ISMIR2020/Appendix - Focus on the segmentation algorithm.html" target="_blank">at this link</a><br>
  <br>
  For more details, you should read the aformentioned article, and take a look at <a class="inner-link" href="./resources/ISMIR2020/Notebooks_mainpage.html" target="_blank">these notebooks</a>, which are HTML uploads of our experimental results while developing the technique.<br>
  <br>
  <h2>Beta-divergence and listenable examples.</h2>
  Recently, we adapted the NTD to other metrics, from the beta-divergence family. In short, this family of divergences generalizes the Euclidean norm (beta = 2), the Kullback-Leibler divergence (beta = 1) and the Itakura-Saito divergence (beta = 0). These last two divergences are well-studied in audio signal processing.<br>
  Details about this work can be found in this <a class="inner-link" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03409508" target="_blank">pre-print</a> (rejected from ICASSP 2022), detailling the algorithm, or in <a class="inner-link" href="https://ax-le.github.io/resources/ICASSP2022/ListeningToNTDResults.html" target="_blank">these listenable results</a>, which are signals reconstructed from the NTD results (both the entire song and each musical pattern), according to different beta values.<br>
  Note though that we used the Griffin-Lim algorithm to reconstruct signals (from the STFT), so reconstructed signals can contain artifacts or unpleasant parts.
